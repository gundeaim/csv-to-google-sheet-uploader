# CSV to Google Sheets Uploader

CSV to Google Sheets Uploader is a JavaFX desktop application that automates transferring CSV transaction data into Google Sheets. The project is structured 
using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, with clear separation of concerns: model for data structures, controller for UI logic, and service for API 
integration. It integrates with the Google Sheets and Drive APIs to streamline data auditing and workflow automation, featuring a responsive GUI, secure
handling of API credentials, and automated formatting of CSV rows. This project demonstrates skills in Java development, API integration, GUI design, 
software architecture, and real-world data automation.
